  Review of State Websites
</head>

<body>
  <h1>Alaska</h1>
  <ul>
    <li> I do like the colors of this website but not so much the design. The colors are eye pleasing but the website just looks kind of old and out dated.</li>
    <li>The website loads quickly</li>
    <li>The menu is easy to navigate. Everything is very user friendly and easy to find.</li>
    <li>The website pretty much stays the same in different screen sizes. If you resize the window and make it smaller, the website doesn't resize or anything, it just stays how it is.</li>
  </ul>

  <h1>Arkansas</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>I love this design and color. It is very pleasing to the eye. The design is super cool and is very nice while you scroll down the website</li>
    <li>The website loads a little slower than usual. It loads pretty fast when you just go straight into it but when you click on links in the website its kind of slow.</li>
    <li>The website is very easy to navigate. You can find items very easy. In the heading theres links that show exactly what you need.</li>
    <li>The website does work very well in multiple screen sizes. Everything resizes exactly how you would want it.</li>
  </ul>

  <h1>Kansas</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>I do not like the color or design of this website</li>
    <li>For me the website loaded pretty quickly. Theres nothing really to load except for a search bar.</li>
    <li>The menu is terrible. I don't know how they thought of this but I really do not like it. All there is is a search bar so you can search for what you want. If you know exactly what you are looking for, the search bar could be helpful, but if you aren't sure exactly what it's called then you are out of luck.</li>
    <li>The website works fine in all screen sizes.</li>
  </ul>

  <h1>Maine</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>Maine.gov has a decent color scheme. It's nothing special but at least it isn't as bad as Kansas.</li>
    <li>The website loads quickly</li>
    <li>The menu is very easy to navigate. It has a trending bar which I really like. It also has a search bar, and a header with links to everything you would need.</li>
    <li>The website works fine in all screen sizes</li>
  </ul>

  <h1>Maryland</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>This color scheme is not my favorite. The red orange and yellow just don't look that great together with the lake and tree picture. </li>
    <li>The website loads quickly</li>
    <li>The menu is very easy to navigate. It has a header with links you will pretty much only use. You can find everything pretty easily.</li>
    <li>Website works fine in all screen sizes.</li>
  </ul>

  <h1>Favorite State Website</h1>
  <p>My favorite state website is definitely Arkansas. The color scheme is very nice and the scrolling animation looks really cool. Everything is super easy to find and it has very cool features with it.</p>

  <h1>Least Favorite State Website</h1>
  <p>My least favorite state website is for sure Kansas. Whoever had the great idea of only a search bar should probably get fired. I'm sure it works fine, but I feel like it is not very user friendly at all. I feel like my grandma could never succeed in finding what she wants if she opened this. There isn't really a color scheme to this website. It is just a big picture in the background. It could be a good website if they just implemented some sort of menu. Final rating is a 2/10. Not the worst website I've ever seen but pretty darn close.</p>
