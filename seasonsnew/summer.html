  <p><img src="surf.jpg" height="230px"></p>

  <p class="summerparagraph">“One of my favorite memories was when we went camping and stayed in a screened shelter type bunkhouse. We went boating, fishing and hydro sliding. I remember my dad caught a few bass, while my mom, sisters and I caught an ice chest FULL of perch. But the most vivid memory from that trip was waking up in the middle of the night to my youngest sister SCREAMING because raccoons had gotten inside and were playing with her hair. Good times.” </p>
