    <p><img src="springdrive.jpg" height="300px"></p>
    <p> “Other than spending time with my family, which of course has to be No. 1, was when I was a senior in high school. Four of my buddies and I drove my 1956 Ford to Virginia Beach and Cape Hatteras [N.C.]. We slept on the beach, and we came back through Washington, D.C. I remember getting stopped by the police …  just for going too fast. The police officer was very nice.”
