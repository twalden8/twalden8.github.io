    <p>Shan Creek, hidden in the small town of Grants Pass, Oregon’s dense forest holds the epitome of Mother Nature. Exemplifying all the senses our beautiful world holds for us. It is an experience not everyone knows of, many are even unaware of the creek’s existence, being a location only a small group of locals know to find. Those who stumble upon this oasis are blown away because Shan Creek is a place of pure beauty, lasting memories, and endless exploration. However, you have to find the creek yourself, the locals of Grants Pass will never share the location of a spot untouched by outsiders.</p1>
    <p>
In the depths of the woods lies the wonders of Shan Creek. Hidden in the labyrinth of the Pacific Northwest forest emerges the crystal clear, never ending, cool, cold blue, mountain runoff water belonging to the creek. This water is surrounded by tan 20 foot scaling boulders, with forest green moss sprouting from all directions. It builds a natural border encasing the water into a 30 foot in diameter swimming hole. The mouth of the creek sits above the pool, creating a rapidly moving shower of white water that continuously pours into the water. On the outskirts of the water and boulders, lies numerous oak trees as high as a big two story house in the gray Southern Oregon sky. Along with numerous different species of vegetation, that create a pallet of numerous colors and shades of green, brown, and blue. Scattered with scars of black charcoal and silver ashes are the burn marks of wildfire, however Life is still abundant. Singing birds hop from limb to limb making a song of nature. Alongside the thunderous crash of water that plays on and on til the end of time. Occasionally, the sounds of rain pitter pattering on the forked leaves appears. Leaving behind the fresh scent of rainfall, mixed together with the coarse dirt and fallen leaves from the previous fall.

A long history of teen memories and mischief belongs to Shan Creek. All starting with fishing trips in the somber winter days catching trout the size of a palm. Shared by one friend to a multitude of more, every trip to the creek creates a memory. Like the time getting plunged into the freezing snow melt after losing balance on a soaked in rain stone on a 40 degree December day. Sometimes leaping into the swimming hole is intentional with a flip or two off the high rising boulders. Even though the water feels like an ice bath even on the blistering July days. A lot of trips in the summer are spent standing rather than indulging in cool refreshment of the water. Most of the memories from Shan Creek are from the time spent with others. Whether it was rekindling friendships from prior years,  or building the bridges to new relationships. Shan Creek is a place that holds many memories from fishing trips in the rainy winters, swimming on the hot summer days, and time spent admiring the surroundings.

<p>
In addition endless exploration continues to peak curiosity after countless trips year after year.  Shan Creek stretches for miles throughout the forest starting high in the Onion Mountain. Then pouring itself into the Rogue River which eventually meets the Pacific Ocean. With wildfires plaguing the state of Oregon every year, the creek is in danger most summers. One year a fire ripped through the woods and charred part of Shan Creek. Almost devastating the beauty of the land for good, but fires brought a lot to the table and continued the adventure. With the addition of dozens of trails carved out from wildland firefighters, the soot and ashes brought along new vibrant orange and dark purple wildflowers. The new vegetation was reminiscent of the cycle of life. Winters will from time to time change surrounding too, an Oregon winter brings downpours of rain for months, creating mudslides or fallen oak trees to discover. Not all the observations of the wild come from the hands of Mother Nature. Countless unknown individuals leave unnatural footprints. The longest standing man made structure is a small rock wall that was built as a dam. This dam has been there for countless years and continues to be improved as the years go by. It holds as the perfect boundary holding in small creek trout, but the origins of why it was created is unknown.

It may seem far fetched, but Shan Creek truly is the embodiment of Mother Nature. However, it is very different from a state or national park. Shan Creek is something special in nature that is unlike anything else. Isolated in a small town packed with history, in a location easy to escape the chaotic and fast paced nature of life. Shan Creek is a spectacular space of nature, filled with stories from the past, and adventure that will continue as long as the creek still runs. There might not be anything else like Shan Creek, but in this world there are countless works of art waiting to be found. - Chase Coyle
